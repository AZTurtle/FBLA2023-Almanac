# FBLA2023-Almanac

A simple word game for the 2022-2023 FBLA Competitive Season.
The theme for this event was centered around making a game similar to Wordle.

The main goal of the game is to form words using the snake of letters you control. Once all letters are removed from the board,
you move on to the next level.

Uses OpenGL and my simple C++ library designed for faster development of games.
